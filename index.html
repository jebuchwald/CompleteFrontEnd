        <p>
          It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? No. I was ashamed to be <i>seen</i> with you.
          I like being with you. I made a huge tiny mistake. No, she's in it. She's a contestant.
          It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned
          about touching. Barry: You said spanking. Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? Coo coo ca chaw.
          Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Am I in two thirds of a hospital room?

        <p>  Ah, yes. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog". You, sir, are a mouthful.  Let's make America America for Americans in an American America again with American Americans.
          I [bleeped] the business model. Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms. Perhaps an attic shall I seek. There are dozens of us! Dozens! Yes, he's like the steel man
          from The Wizard From Oz. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! Shémale. </p>
        <p> Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called
          Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained
          everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC?
          What's up, fizz-ellas. Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call…
          Hey campers! This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. </p>

        <p> Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. Ah coodle doodle doo,
          ah coodle doodle doo. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it.
          Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? </p>
        <p>And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect– No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. I'm sure,
          wherever your father is, she loves you very much. I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. Happy Franklin Friday.
          I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times.
          And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking. That's not what I WAS thinking.
